_always learning, always creating_

__Senior Software Engineer with 22+ years of professional experience.__

## Summary

20+ years of experience reading and writing software, following solid development processes and practices, and engaging with teams to deliver software that matters.

I'm incredibly grateful to have grown up surrounded by Apple IIs and Atari, Commodores, and NES. My parents couldn't set the clock on the VCR; thus, my career was born. I have an unending love of learning and a passion for creating, which remains to this day a substantial driving force behind my journey in Engineering, from Legos to Fullstack Development.
